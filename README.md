## Documentation Repositories

The documentation is actually stored in two seperate repositorys:

- [bevry/documentation](https://github.com/bevry/documentation) for general documentation for miscelanous bevry projects and whatever
- [docpad/documentation](https://github.com/docpad/documentation) for docpad specific documentation

These repositories are pulled into this website for rendering at run-time.

If you wish to update documentation content, you'll need to make changes to those repositories instead. Changes in repository are only for customising the design and rendering of the documentation.
